#  Image Filtering Exploration: From Noisy Chaos to Pristine Detail ✨

**Delve into the art of image filtering using Python's scikit-image library, Jupyter Notebooks, and the iconic "cameraman" image!**

##  Key Experiments

- **Noise Injection:** Injecting salt-and-pepper and Gaussian noise into the cameraman image to simulate degradation.
- **Low-Pass Filtering:** Applying median, mean, and Gaussian filters for noise reduction and detail preservation.
- **High-Pass Filtering:** Exploring Prewitt and Sobel filters to enhance edges and analyze their characteristics.
- **Thresholding:** Segmenting the image into binary representations using global and adaptive thresholding techniques.
- **Canny Edge Detection:** Unleashing the Canny filter to reveal the sharpest edges with remarkable noise resilience.

##  Key Findings

- Different filters excel in specific noise scenarios, balancing noise suppression and detail retention.
- Thresholding proves effective for basic segmentation but requires careful parameter tuning.
- Canny stands out in edge detection, offering precise outlines and superior noise tolerance.
